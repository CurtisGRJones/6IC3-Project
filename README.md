# 6IC3-Project

## Goal
To create a connection between a slave Arduino to a PLC using the ModbusTCP protocol and control a few
misc prices of equiptment as a POC of this process 

## Phases

### 1
 - Make arduino communicate using modbus TCP to a PC

### 2
 - Connect the following equiptment
	1x Servo Motor
	1x LED using PWM
	1x Buzzer
	Pushbutton
	Photoresitior using Analog in
 - Configure the slave node to modify values when working with modbus

### 3
 - Connect to PLC
 - Program PLC to respect the coils of the arduino
